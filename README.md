## ⚖️ Deterrent Punishment System (Jail)

Our **Deterrent Punishment System** introduces a strict and highly effective method for handling rule violations within the server. This system is designed to prevent players from evading their penalties and ensures that they serve the full duration of their jail time while in-game.

### Key Features:

- **Real-Time Jail Monitoring:**
  If a player logs out or disconnects during their jail time, the timer stops. The player must remain in the game for their sentence to be served fully.

- **Elimination of Ineffective Warning Systems:**
  We have removed the ineffective warning system used via Discord, as players often disregarded warnings and continued to break rules, assuming that a simple warning wouldn't affect them much. The new system introduces serious consequences for rule violations.

- **Automated Jail for Rule Violations:**
  Each rule violation results in automatic jail time. The duration of the jail sentence corresponds directly to the severity of the rule broken. Once jailed, the player cannot leave the jail under any circumstances until their time is served.

- **Hack-Proof Jail System:**
  The system is designed to prevent any form of escape. Even cheats and hacks won’t work to bypass the jail. Players are placed in a **restricted WORLD AREA**, where movement and interaction with the rest of the game are completely disabled.

### Player Experience in Jail:

- **Time Stops if Offline:** Players attempting to evade jail time by logging off will find their time frozen. They must be logged in and active for the jail timer to count down.
- **Locked in a Restricted Area:** During jail time, players are isolated in an area with no interaction or movement possible. They are effectively "locked down" until the timer expires.
  
This system enforces a more serious and disciplined environment, preventing repeated rule violations and ensuring that players face the consequences of their actions within the game.
